Weather-App
===========

Android Studio was used to complete the app.

Weather API: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=35.9886&lon=-78.9072

I decided to go for the challenge and the API get the current location of the user and display the weather for that location. Kelvin was successfully converted to Fahrenheit.

Font: Nunito-Light 

I couldn't find Avenir-Book for Android, so I looked for a font that was similar to it.

Color: UIColor darkGrayColor is #555555
